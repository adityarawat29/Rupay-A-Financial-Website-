# Rupay-A-Financial-Website-

This another A small Project related to HTML and CSS , in the CSS we have created with CSS3 using Flex etc. 

Also i have made this html page a little bit repsonive when the page opens in small screen like mobile phones or in iPad or tablet, although 
some of the alignment is still needs to be fixed so i'll update it as soon as possible.

To check the WebSite Layout , Go to Website Images folder and check out the how website is looking .

Note: I have used a little bit of Jquery when you run this website and click on the Navigation links you'll see the scroll happens smoothly .

All the images has been downlaoded from pexels.com .
